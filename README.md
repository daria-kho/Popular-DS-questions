# Popular-DS-questions
The body of the project is inside the Popular Data Science Questions on Stack Exchange.ipynb file
The hypothertical client's request for this project was to research the topics to include in a new educational resourse (a book, a MOOC or a game) on Data Science.
I work with Stack Exchange Data Science community data to determine which Data Science topics are the most popular among the users.
